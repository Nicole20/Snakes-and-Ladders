Snakes-and-Ladders
==================
This project was first a group project, in teams of three. It covered the simple topics learnt in class and was less of a challenge in a team. So I decided to start the project over on my own and add any features I wanted.
This is a 3D Snakes and Ladders board game using OpenGL. The placement of the snakes and the ladders are random. It has a dice rolling animation and the player movement animation.
